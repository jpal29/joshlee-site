    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Data analyst with 5+ years of professional experience working across a variety of business organizations including operations, sales, and product management. Currently, I specialize in setting up setting up processes to gather data that help to provide consumable and informative data visualizations. These pretty little pictures in turn allow me to provide thorough and rigorous statistical analysis of data that drive important business decisions. In previous roles I have had experience working in technical customer support       , sales operations, web development, and going "undercover" (ask me about it).</p>
    
    <p>When I'm not busy being a hyper-passionate worker, you can find me running (not for my life, just for fun), snowboarding, and trying to learn how to build a website. Also, I do some coding stuff that you can see below. Some other odds and ends might also be down there.</p>

    <h4>Expected troop loss in a risk attack</h4>
    <p>Calculator to estimate number of troops lost in attack and defense in a turn of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)">risk</a>. I had lost a few rounds of risk and was later shown a reddit post that had a probability calculator of whether or not a Risk attack would fail (or succeed). Reading it made me wonder if there could be a way to also estimate the number of troops lost in a given attack or defence. There had been several times when I probably wouldn't have launched an attack if I had known how many troops would be lost in the process.</p>
    
    <p>Since the code in the reddit post already used Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability of winning or losing the attack, I simply had to add a little something to keep track of the troops lost during the attack. Then, it was just as simple as sticking that code inside a Shiny App that could display the expected troops remaining. <a href= "http://joshlee.cc/risk-outcomes">Finished product</a> in case you need it.</p>
